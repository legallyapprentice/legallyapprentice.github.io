  <p><strong>Legally Apprentice</strong> is a student-led initiative dedicated to helping aspiring legal professionals access solicitor and paralegal apprenticeships. We believe that the legal profession should be open to everyone, regardless of background, and we aim to provide clear, relatable guidance to make that happen.</p>

  <p>Our mission is to demystify the apprenticeship route into law, share real-life journeys, and connect students with opportunities and support. Whether you're just starting to explore legal careers or actively applying, we're here to help.</p>
